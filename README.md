## Developing:

###Cards
All the cards are located in the js/cards.js file.  For now only the general section is used.
Remember with javascript, the last element in an array or an object should NOT have a comma after it.

###Working locally
`npm instal -g http-server`
`cd /where/you/cloned/this/repo`
`http-sever .`
