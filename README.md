## Developing:

###Cards
All the cards are located in the js/cards.js file.  For now only the general section is used.
Remember with javascript, the last element in an array or an object should NOT have a comma after it.

###Working locally
*  `git clone git@github.com:CoquiCoders/bumpyJourney.git`
*  `npm install -g http-server`
*  `cd /where/you/cloned/this/repo`
*  `http-sever .`

### Committing and Pushing
Commit as normal.
However, when you push,

`push origin gh-pages`

You should be able to see the build site at
